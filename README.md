## 🧩 Overview  

**1Password for macOS** is a next-generation password manager built to keep your digital life secure, organized, and effortless. Developed by **AgileBits**, it protects everything from your logins and credit cards to secure notes and two-factor authentication codes — all in one encrypted vault that only you can unlock.  

Every password, document, or digital identity you store is secured using **end-to-end encryption** and a **Master Password**, ensuring that even 1Password’s servers can’t access your data. The app automatically fills credentials across websites and apps, helping you save time while maintaining strong security hygiene.  

1Password isn’t just a password manager — it’s a **complete digital security suite**. Features like **Watchtower** alert you to compromised accounts, **Travel Mode** safeguards data while abroad, and **Shared Vaults** simplify collaboration for families and teams.  

Designed for macOS, 1Password offers full **Apple Silicon support**, beautiful native design, and deep integration with Safari and system autofill. Whether you’re managing personal security or protecting your business, 1Password provides the reliability, privacy, and convenience you need to stay in control.
